# Discord Countdown Bot
A simple python Discord bot to return a countdown to custom date-times to the second.
This was made as a customizable future-proof improvement on my "Smash Countdown" Discord bot.

All times in UTC


# Commands
All commands are case insensitive

* 'time till [title]'

Returns the remaining time to the countdown specified with [title]



* 'new timer, [title], [year], [month], [day], [hour], [minute], [second]

Adds a new timer to timers.json with specified parameters that can be checked using the 'time till [title]' command
